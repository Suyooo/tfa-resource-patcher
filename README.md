This is a modded version of the patcher from the original Bartizan project, just for resource patching. Currently, it can add sprites into a sprite atlas by looking for free space in the atlas.

TO DO:
- simple XML patching (theme data etc.)
- replace sprites
- do hash checking against "official" version of the atlas XMLs, and hardcode free space for those. Saves time for unmodded installations of TFA
- music patching? Is that even possible? If not just do a simple binary patcher, w/e lol
